# 17th and 18th Century Poetry (1660-1798)

## 1. Background

New literary movements emerged after the restoration period:

- **The Enlightenment** was a movement that sparked new confidence in human ability, leading to a wave of inventions, research, and new ideas.
- **Mass media production** emerged with the rise of the **printing press** , which quickly spread written works like novels, essays, satire, journalism, etc to the common man.

Notable people in the Enlightenment movement include:

- **John Locke** was an English philosopher who wrote the famous Theory of Rights stating that all humans shall have the "_rights of life, liberty and property_."
- **Voltaire** was a French writer who attacked the Catholic Church by advocating for freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and separation of church and state.
- **Isaac Newton** published a study of gravity.
