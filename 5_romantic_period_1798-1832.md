# Romantic Period (1798-1832)

## 1. Background

An  artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe. It focused on nature, spontaneity, imagination and emotions. A literary rebellion to change from an agricultural society to industrial nation.

> Romanticism affected arts and culture in general. Its main feature was a reaction against the eighteenth century and the Age of Reason. In fact, "Romanticism", or the "Romantic Movement", was a reaction against the rationalism of the eighteenth century, the view of the physical world increasingly dominated by science, and the mental world by the neoclassicism of the Enlightenment. During the Romantic period changes in various fields took place: in philosophy, literature, politics, religion, music and painting. All changes were represented and symbolized by the English Romantic poets. The Romantic period coincided with the French Revolution. It was seen as a political enactment of the ideas of Romanticism, which, at the beginning, involved breaking out of the restrictive patterns and models of the past.
